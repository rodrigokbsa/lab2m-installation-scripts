# Scripts for automatic installation

This repository is an group of super simple scripts to automate the process installation of some programs that I use in Linux Mint, Ubuntu and Debian. Usually versions not founded in official repositories.

I'm not a shell script professional, so be free to pull requesting and improve this work to the community.
